1. Purpose: 
The goal of this project is to visualize COVID-19 data around the globe for easier search and review. 
The project will organize daily updates and historical COVID-19 data using country, time and region filters.
After applying the filters, the project will illustrate daily and total number of confirmed cases/deaths/vaccinations, 
trend over time including cases over the last 14 days and overall fatality rate change, as of the last update date of the dashboard. 
The project will also provide an overview on global/continental summary of key factors on the map.
